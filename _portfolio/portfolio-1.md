## Overview

Designed and developed a local MCP Server to automate pipeline log analysis for Azure DevOps during a Microsoft Hackathon. This solution integrates with AI agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot) to autonomously fetch logs, detect failure patterns in seconds, and maintain complete data integrity—all without external data uploads.

## Key Features

- **Automated Log Analysis**: Autonomously fetches and analyzes pipeline logs from Azure DevOps
- **AI Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with AI agents like GitHub Copilot for intelligent analysis
- **Rapid Failure Detection**: Detects failure patterns in seconds, significantly reducing debugging time
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains complete data integrity without external data uploads
- **Workflow Optimization**: Streamlined debugging workflows for engineering teams by eliminating manual log triage

## Impact

Streamlined debugging workflows for engineering teams by eliminating manual log triage, enabling rapid root cause identification and continuous integration efficiency.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Azure Events
- Azure Functions
- Jupyter Notebooks
