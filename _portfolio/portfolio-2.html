## Overview

Developed a Binomial Options Pricing Model in Python to estimate the value of European call and put options as a personal project. The model incorporates factors such as underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility.

## Key Features

- **Options Valuation**: Estimates the value of both European call and put options
- **Comprehensive Parameters**: Incorporates underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility
- **Data Validation**: Validated the model using historical options data
- **Market Comparison**: Compared model results to actual market prices for accuracy verification
- **Financial Analysis**: Demonstrates understanding of financial derivatives and quantitative analysis

## Implementation Details

The model uses the binomial tree approach to calculate option prices, providing a discrete-time framework for valuing options. This method is particularly useful for understanding the step-by-step evolution of option values over time.
